# Compatibility wrappers

This folder contains thin wrappers for legacy paths like `examples/00_*.py`.
Each wrapper forwards to the matching script in `examples/tutorial/` so older
commands still work, while keeping all runnable scripts inside topic folders.

If you are starting fresh, prefer the tutorial scripts directly.
